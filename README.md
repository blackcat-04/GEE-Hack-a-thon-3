# Overarching goal
To investigate the forest cover change in the Kruger national park, South Africa between 2000 and 2014

# Challenge aims
- Map forest cover change from the Hansen et al. Database for your group's protected area as well for the larger region surrounding the protected area
- Create a figure in R visualising the amounts of forest cover change over time
- Report the state of forests in your group's protected area in a Markdown document

# Title

Mapping forest cover between 2000 and 2014 in the Kruger National Park, South Africa

# Authors

_*Izzy, Elspseth, Amy, Joseph, Caitlin, Ron.*_


# Research question
__How much forest cover loss and gain has occurred in your protected area?__


# Introduction

The Kruger National park, spanning almost 2 million hectares, is an unbeaten oasis nested in the Mpumalanga province, South Africa. Established in 1898 as a recognised protected area, it is home to 336 tree species and wide diversity of species. Mapping the change in forest cover provides invaluable insight as to how the park is responding to global change and how conservation techniques are preserving one of the most beautiful safaris in the world. 

# Workflow

_*Write out or draw your workflow in text here, on paper or in a ppt slide and then take a photo of that to include.*_


# Specific hypotheses and predictions

_*What do you know about this protected area?  What sort of factors could influence forest cover change in this part of the world?*_


# Methods

_*Describe your methods in brief including all of the datasets that you used with appropriate crediting/referencing/copyright for the datasets.*_


# Data vis and summary methods

_*Describe your data visualisation, any mathematical summaries and/or any statistical methods that you used in brief. Include any relevant R code snippets.*_

```r
Your code
```

# 1. Maps of forest cover change for your protected area

_*Describe your results using appropriate scientific writing. Include maps of your protected area with informative captions.*_

_*Your maps*_


# 2. Visualisation of the amount of forest cover loss and gain for your protected area
(you can use `R`)

__*Your text and/or figures.*__


# 3. How do your results compare with your predictions? What do you think might explain the patterns you found?

_*Use your scientific and critical thinking skills to provide a conclusion summary statement of how land cover is changing across the protected area that you studied.*_

__*Your text and/or figures.*__


# 4. What other datasets, available within the GEE, could you use to test the potential drivers of forest cover change in your group's protected area that you identified in point #3. ?

_*Browse through the GEE Data catalogue and provide a link to your chosen dataset with a brief statement about why you chose it. Note you don't need to do analyses with this new dataset, you are just making a suggestion for future studies.*_

__*Link and description of your chosen dataset*__

_*BONUS! If you have the time, for some bonus recognition, map your chosen dataset in the GEE and include a visualisation of the dataset for your protected area (screencap from GEE).*_


# 5. What research question and hypotheses would you test with those additional datasets in your proposed future research and why does that research matter for the park management?

_*Add your answer here.*_


# Conclusions

_*Summarise what you have found in this challenge and its broader implications.*_
